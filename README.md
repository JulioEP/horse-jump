This project tries to complete a chessboard with a knight using backtracking algorithm and recursion.

What's a chessboard?
A chessboard is the type of chequerboard used in the board game chess, over which the chess pieces are laid. It's usually square in shape, with a peculiar pattern of alternating two colours between its subdivisions. Its side being divided into eight parts, resulting in a total of sixty-four subdivisions.

The knight (♘ ♞) is a piece in the game of chess, representing a knight (armored cavalry). It is normally represented by a horse's head and neck.
